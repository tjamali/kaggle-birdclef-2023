# BirdCLEF 2023 Audio Classification / Sound Event Detection

This repository contains a reproducible pipeline for the **BirdCLEF 2023** Kaggle competition: identifying bird species from audio recordings by training deep models on mel-spectrogram representations. The codebase is structured around audio preprocessing, data splitting, augmentation, model definition, training, checkpointing, and evaluation.

### High-level Flow

1. **Audio Preparation**: `prepare_audios.py` converts raw `.ogg` audio into trimmed/resampled `.npy` arrays.
2. **Data Splitting**: `split_data.py` merges audio metadata with available `.npy` files, builds label strings, and assigns stratified k-folds on `primary_label`.
3. **Transforms**: `transforms.py` defines augmentations (audio-level and image-level), mel-spectrogram computation, CutMix/MixUp utilities, and conversion to 3-channel images.
4. **Dataset**: `dataset.py` creates mixed spectrogram images per sample (mixing primary/background birds), applies augmentations, and constructs target vectors with label smoothing.
5. **Model**: `model.py` implements the backbone architectures (EfficientNet via `timm`), attention blocks, and SED composition.
6. **Training**: `train.py` orchestrates training/validation loops, handles rare-bird logic, checkpointing, learning rate scheduling, and logging.
7. **Metrics**: `metrics.py` defines focal losses, aggregation meters, and the padded cmap scoring used for evaluation.
8. **Checkpointing**: `checkpoint.py` handles saving/loading to resume runs safely.
9. **Scheduler**: `scheduler.py` provides flexible LR scheduler selection via config.
10. **Visualization**: `plot_loss_metric.py` plots training/validation loss and cmap score per fold.

## ⚙️ Setup & Dependencies

You can create a Python environment and install required packages. A sample `requirements.txt` might include:

```text
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
torch
timm
transformers
librosa
soundfile
torchlibrosa
albumentations
matplotlib
joblib
tqdm
colorednoise
path  # the `path` PyPI package, not pathlib
````

Install via:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** Mixed precision is optionally used (`apex`-style via `torch.cuda.amp`). No external Apex dependency is required because PyTorch's native AMP is used.

## 🧪 Configuration

All experiment-level settings live in `configs.py`. Key fields include:

* `exp_id`, `seed`, `epochs`, `folds`, `lr`, `weight_decay`
* `train_bs`, `valid_bs`, `base_model_name` (e.g., `"tf_efficientnet_b0_ns"`)
* `scheduler_name` and `scheduler_params` (e.g., `'reduce_lr_on_plateau'`)
* `label_smoothing`, `pretrained`, audio/spec parameters (`sample_rate`, `period`, `n_mels`, etc.)
* `debug`: set to `True` to run with a small subset and increased verbosity.

Logger configuration is centralized: after instantiating `Config`, call `configure_logger(config)` so that `config.debug` controls verbosity.

Example:

```python
from configs import Config, configure_logger

config = Config()
configure_logger(config)
```

## 🚀 Training

1. **Prepare audio arrays** (one-time):

```bash
python prepare_audios.py
```

2. **Build train split with k-folds**:

```bash
python split_data.py
```

This will update `train.csv` with a `kfold` column.

3. **Run training**:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script:

* Loads and splits the data.
* Handles rare bird classes to ensure they stay in training folds.
* Builds datasets with augmentation.
* Instantiates model (`SED`), optimizer, scheduler.
* Resumes from checkpoints if available.
* Saves best checkpoints based on validation loss.
* Stores training histories (loss/score) per fold.

### Notes

* Scheduler stepping: `reduce_lr_on_plateau` expects `scheduler.step(metric)` while others use `scheduler.step()`.
* Checkpoints are saved with descriptive filenames including epoch, loss, and cmap score.
* Rare birds (`brcwea1`, `lotcor1`, `whhsaw1`) are forcefully adjusted in folds to avoid them being absent from training splits.

## 🧠 Data Augmentation

* **Audio-level**: normalization, noise injection (white, pink), pitch shift, time stretch.
* **Spectrogram-level**: random power contrast changes, CutMix, MixUp, frequency shaping.
* **Label smoothing**: controlled via config; softens targets (e.g., primary bird gets 0.995 instead of 1.0).

## 📌 Checkpointing & Resuming

`checkpoint.py` exposes helpers to load the latest saved model or specific checkpoint. The training loop calls:

```python
checkpoint = get_initial_checkpoint(config)
if checkpoint:
    last_epoch, _ = load_checkpoint(model, optimizer, checkpoint)
```

Ensure `config.train_dir` is properly set before training (the script does this per fold).

## 📊 Evaluation / Visualization

After or during training, visualize metrics with:

```bash
python plot_loss_metric.py <train_dir> [fold] [optional_save_path]
```

Example:

```bash
python plot_loss_metric.py models/Exp_47/fold_0 0 fold0.png
```

This plots:

* Training/validation loss.
* `cmap_pad_5` score (padded class-wise average precision).

## 🧩 Miscellaneous

* The project avoids wildcard imports in updated files; every module imports only what it needs (improves readability and static analysis).
* The target vector construction in `WaveformDataset` distinguishes primary vs. background birds with different weights.
* The `metrics.py` defines a custom padded average precision (`padded_cmap`) to stabilize evaluation on imbalanced classes.

## 🛠 Example Minimal Run

```python
from configs import Config, configure_logger
from train import run
import pandas as pd

config = Config()
configure_logger(config)
train_df = pd.read_csv(config.train_dataframe_path)
run(train_df)
```

## ✔️ Tips & Best Practices

* Always call `configure_logger(config)` early to control verbosity via `config.debug`.
* Use the saved checkpoint naming convention to trace experiments (epoch, loss, cmap).
* If changing model/backbone, update `base_model_name` in `configs.py` and potentially adjust input shapes.
* Avoid modifying the core logic when tuning; adjust via config parameters when possible.

## 🧩 Future Improvements

* Extract experiment parameters to YAML/CLI for easier sweep management.
* Add unit tests for transformation and dataset logic.
* Support multi-GPU / distributed training.
* Export submission pipeline for inference on test set.
